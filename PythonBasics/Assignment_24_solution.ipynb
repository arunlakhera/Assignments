    "\n",
    "Conciseness: Lambda expressions are usually shorter and more concise than regular named functions. This makes them easier to read and write, and can reduce code clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anonymity: Lambda expressions are anonymous functions, which means they don't have a name that takes up space in the code. This is useful when you only need to define a function once and use it in a single context, such as passing it as an argument to another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Lambda expressions can be used wherever a function object is expected, such as in higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(). This provides more flexibility and allows for more concise code than defining a separate named function for each use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: Lambda expressions can make code more readable when used appropriately, since they can make the intent of the code more clear by eliminating the need for a separate function definition that may be far from the context of its use."
