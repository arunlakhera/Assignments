    "There are several choices for increasing the comparison between different figures on the same graph:\n",

    "Increase the contrast: One way to increase the comparison between different figures is to increase the contrast of the graph. This can be done by adjusting the color scheme or by using a different type of plot that emphasizes the differences between the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a log scale: If the data covers a wide range of values, using a log scale can make it easier to compare different figures. This is because a log scale compresses the range of values, making it easier to see the differences between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use different markers or line styles: Using different markers or line styles for different figures can make it easier to distinguish between them. For example, you could use solid lines for one figure and dashed lines for another, or use circles for one figure and triangles for another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use labels and legends: Adding labels and legends to the graph can help to identify the different figures and make it easier to compare them. This can include adding titles, axis labels, and a legend that explains the meaning of each line or marker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalize the data: If the data is measured in different units or has different scales, normalizing the data can make it easier to compare the figures. This involves scaling the data so that it has a common range or unit, such as scaling all values to be between 0 and 1."
