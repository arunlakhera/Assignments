NumPy arrays can be created with a fixed size and shape, and can be indexed and sliced using integer-based indices. NumPy arrays are highly optimized for numerical operations and are often used in scientific computing and numerical analysis.\n",

DataFrames can be created from a variety of data sources, such as CSV files, SQL databases, and Excel spreadsheets. DataFrames are highly optimized for data manipulation and analysis, and offer powerful features for data grouping, aggregation, and filtering.\n",
