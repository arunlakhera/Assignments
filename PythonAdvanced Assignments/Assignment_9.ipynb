When you read from or write to a text-mode file, Python automatically converts between the file's encoding and the Unicode string format used in Python. In contrast, when you read from or write to a binary-mode file, no such conversion takes place.\n",

When you write to a text-mode file, Python automatically converts the \\n character used in Python to the appropriate line ending for the operating system you are running on (e.g. \\r\\n for Windows, \\n for Unix). When you read from a text-mode file, Python automatically converts any line endings used in the file to the \\n character used in Python. In binary-mode files, line endings are not automatically handled and are preserved exactly as they appear in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading and writing: In text-mode files, you read and write data as Unicode strings. In binary-mode files, you read and write data as bytes. This means that when you read from a binary-mode file, you get back a bytes object, and when you write to a binary-mode file, you must write bytes objects.\n",
