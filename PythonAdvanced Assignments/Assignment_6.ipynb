    "\n",
    "Error handling: When a program encounters an error, it can raise an exception to signal an error condition. The exception can then be caught and handled by the program, allowing it to recover gracefully from the error. For example, if a program needs to open a file, it can use exception handling to catch and handle any file I/O errors that may occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: Another application of exception processing is resource management. When a program uses external resources such as files, network connections, or database connections, it needs to ensure that these resources are properly managed and released when they are no longer needed. Exception handling can be used to catch and handle errors that may occur during resource allocation or deallocation, ensuring that resources are properly managed and released.\n",
    "\n",
    "Program flow control: A third application of exception processing is program flow control. Exceptions can be used to change the flow of a program when certain conditions are met. For example, a program may use exceptions to implement a retry mechanism when a network operation fails, or to exit a loop when a particular condition is met."
